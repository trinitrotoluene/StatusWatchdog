## About

StatusWatchdog is a modern, API-first self-hostable status page. The RESTful backend API is Swagger-documented and entirely usable on its own. Most deployments will probably choose to use the included Vue.JS based client application which provides both public and administration UI views.

## Setup

**TODO**

## UI Screenshots
**Current state of the project, more views and screenshots coming soon.**
